    <string name="about_first">ScanSmart is a free application that scans barcodes (including Wifi barcodes) and also uses pictures to extract phone numbers, e-mails and wifi passwords to use them. I would appreciate it if you could help me make it better with suggestions or report to me any problems you had using it.</string>
