 - copy text from photo
 - extract phone number displayed in photo and dial it
 - extract e-mail address displayed in photo and send message to it
 - scan WiFi barcodes and automatically connect to network if it's in range
 - take photo of router sticker, extract wifi password, and automatically connect to network if it's in range.
