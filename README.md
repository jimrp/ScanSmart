 - scan barcodes (of course),  
 - take a photo (or use a saved one), extract text from it and copy it to clipboard
 - take a photo, extract phone number from it and dial it
 - take a photo, extract e-mail address from it, open e-mail app and add extracted e-mail to recipients
 - scan WiFi barcodes and automatically connect to network if it's in range
 - take photo of router sticker, extract wifi password, and automatically connect to network if it's in range.
