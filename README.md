# ScanSmart

An android application that is not just a barcode scanner. It's a lot more than that.
It can:
 - scan barcodes (of course),  
 - take photo (or use a saved one), extract text from it and copy it to clipboard
 - take photo, extract phone number from it and dial it
 - take photo, extract e-mail address from it and add it to recipients
 - scan WiFi barcodes and automatically connect to network if it's in range
 - take photo of router sticker, extract wifi password, and automatically connect to network if it's in range.
 
 Coming soon..
